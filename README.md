## About The Project

This challenge will be a perfect test of your layout and responsive skills. There's a tiny bit of JS for the mobile menu, but the focus is HTML & CSS.
The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## Built with

- [Vue js](https://vuejs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## What I learned

Good project if you are just starting out or need to practice the basics like class toggle based on some state change.

```html
<div :class="[isActive ? ['p-4', 'block'] : 'hidden']">{{some state}}</div>
```
