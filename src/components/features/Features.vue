                    <h3>Introducing an extensible editor</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blogr features an exceedingly
                        intuitive interface which lets you focus on one thing: creating content. The
                        editor supports management of multiple blogs and allows easy manipulation of
                        embeds such as images, videos, and Markdown. Extensibility with plugins and
                        themes provide easy ways to add functionality or change the looks of a blog.
